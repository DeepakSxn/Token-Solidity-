# Token

This Solidity program is a simple program that demonstrates the creation of Token. The purpose of this program is to show the basic details of token and operations.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a two main functionn that returns mint(add) or burn(remove) a unit(value) at a specific address and Three variable to store token details(name,abrv,supply). This program serves as a simple exapmle of token and smart contract.
### Getting Started

1.firstly the version of solidity

2.Creation of smart contract 
  i.  Add variable for token details(name , abrv , supply) also Map address to get balance of the given address wallet.
  ii. Create a mint function for adding value to a given anddress and also the change it in total supply(moslty add)
  iii. Create a burn function for buring the deletion(burnig) the value in the given address and also the change it in total supply

#### Executing Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a `.sol` extension (e.g.,Token.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

Atlast run and enjoy!!!
